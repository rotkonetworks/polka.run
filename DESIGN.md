### Backend (Client-Side Data Management and Processing)

1. **Setup and Dependencies**:
   - Integrate Leptos and `[rexie](https://crates.io/crates/rexie)` for IndexedDB interactions.
   - Define IndexedDB schema for storing .polkavm files.

2. **IndexedDB Data Management**:
   - Develop functions for efficient reading(web_sys::FileReader) from and writing to IndexedDB.
   - Implement pagination in IndexedDB for handling large data sets.

3. **On-Demand Data Processing**:
   - Utilize `[gloo worker](https://docs.rs/gloo-worker/latest/gloo_worker/)` for creating web workers.
   - Implement logic in workers to fetch and process file segments from IndexedDB based on requests from the frontend.
   - Or alternatively process all data on load and store in IndexedDB for on-demand retrieval to avoid any processing in UI side.

4. **Chunk-based Processing with Web Workers**:
   - Web Workers handle disassembly of file segments.
   - Determine segment size dynamically for optimized processing.
   - Save processed data in IndexedDB for on-demand retrieval.

5. **Data Storage and Retrieval Strategy**:
   - Store the entire .polkavm file as a Blob in IndexedDB initially.
   - Develop a mechanism for on-demand data retrieval based on user scroll position in the frontend.

6. **Testing and Optimization of Data Layer**:
   - Test the data management layer with various file sizes.
   - Optimize data fetching and storage operations.

### Frontend (User Interface and Interaction)

1. **Interactive Master Scroll UI**:
   - Implement an interactive scroll bar in the UI representing the entire blob.
   - This scroll bar allows users to quickly navigate and jump to any point within the data.
   - Clicking on a specific position on the scroll bar updates the `OffsetScrollState` to load the corresponding data chunk.

2. **Dynamic Offset Calculation**:
   - Calculate the offset dynamically based on the user's selection on the master scroll bar.
   - The calculation should translate the scroll bar position to the correct offset within the blob.

3. **Enhanced Data Loading on Offset Change**:
   - Extend the data loading mechanism to fetch data from IndexedDB corresponding to the new offset whenever the `OffsetScrollState` changes.
   - Ensure that both `MemoryDumpView` and `DisassemblyView` update accordingly, displaying the relevant chunk.

4. **Optimized Individual View Scrolling**:
   - Maintain smooth and independent scrolling within `MemoryDumpView` and `DisassemblyView`.
   - Each view should handle its own scroll events without impacting the master scroll UI.

5. **Performance and Usability Optimization**:
   - Optimize data fetching and rendering for rapid updates, ensuring a seamless user experience when jumping to different data points.

6. **Comprehensive Testing for Jump-to-Data Feature**:
   - Test the jump-to-data functionality extensively to ensure accurate offset calculations and responsive data loading.
   - Validate the feature across various scenarios and data sizes for robustness and accuracy.
